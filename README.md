# Order Processing MIS.

iOrder is a light weight prototype for a order processing MIS.

# Features
1. Centralized order management

Merchants definitely benefit from providing the buyers with a wide range of payment services to complete their transaction. Therefore, they pay attention to the order management systems that support multiple payment options. It is important to integrate with fraud check services for merchants' security.

2. Inventory management

Online store owners do their best to ensure good service for their clients. Syncing your inventory with an OMS is essential for this, as it helps avoid receiving orders for items that are out of stock or are no more available. This feature is also important for reserving goods added to the cart but not yet purchased and updating the stock levels correspondingly.
Fulfillment points integration

If a store has several fulfillment points, fulfillment integration enables to define which of the points to use for the order based on its location and item availability.

3. Shipping services integration

Even once the item is dispatched for shipping and merchant's work seems to be over, the order isn't yet completed. Both the buyer and the seller want to know 'how it goes', so integration with shipping services is indispensable. Your OMS software should provide as many shipping integrations as possible since eCommerce businesses now tend to extend the circle of delivery options for the sake of customer convenience and reduced shipping costs.

In view of the possibility of receiving payment upon delivery, this feature will allow tracking and processing payments collected by shipping companies.

4. Customer management

Service level can never be too high, so entrepreneurs do their best to eliminate any worries on their buyers' side and answer any questions before they're even asked. For instance, notifying a person about their order being received, processed, and shipped with detailed info on each stage. An order management system should be able to automatedly send corresponding emails using certain triggers to let customer service agents focus on dealing with individual requests.

Integration to customer service systems would be a big advantage, enabling agents to view, process, and edit order information while communicating with customers.
